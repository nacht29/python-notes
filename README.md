# python-notes

## Introduction

As the name and about implies, this repo contains some notes I made while learning Python. The notes are separated into different Pytjon notebooks, each concerning a concept in Python. I hope the notes will be of help to those who come across them.

### Data Cleaning
As a special mention, **[data-cleaning](https://github.com/nacht29/python-notes/tree/main/data-cleaning)** directory contains an example of how to clean data in Python. Do anticipate more updates as I gain more knowledge about this.
